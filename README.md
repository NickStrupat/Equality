# Equality
The last .NET equality solution you'll ever need. Automatically produces equality comparison and hash-code generation for any type by emitting IL based on your type. Emitted code is cached and specialized for struct and class types. Specify fields and auto-properties to ignore, as well as properties you want to include by applying attributes.
